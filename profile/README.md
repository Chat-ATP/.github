# ChatATP

**Empowering LLMs with Toolkits as Capabilities.**

Welcome to **ChatATP**, the company pioneering the **Agent Tool Protocol (ATP)** — the foundation for turning Large Language Models (LLMs) into fully capable **AI Agents** that can act, automate, and integrate with the real world.

---

## 📌 Who We Are

**ChatATP** is a forward-thinking AI infrastructure company building the protocol layer for intelligent agents. Our mission is to make AI not just conversational, but *capable* — by giving it tools, structure, and purpose through a plug-and-play protocol.

We're creating the infrastructure that allows developers, businesses, and platforms to build and deploy AI Agents that can truly get things done.

---

## 💼 What We Do

- 🧩 **Agent Tool Protocol (ATP):** A protocol for LLMs to access tools and APIs securely.
- 🧰 **ToolKits:** Developer-built tools that LLMs can call to perform real-world actions (API calls, scraping, automation, analysis, etc.).
- 🤖 **ChatATP Platform:** Where users create AI Agents by combining LLMs and ToolKits in a synced workspace.
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer SDKs:** Tooling that lets developers build, register, and monetize ToolKits on the ATP ecosystem.
- 🏢 **Business AI Solutions:** Custom AI Agent deployments for companies, fully white-labeled or integrated.

## 🌍 Our Vision

We envision a future where every user, business, and app can deploy **autonomous AI agents** — not as distant sci-fi, but as everyday infrastructure.

> **“AI is no longer just an interface — it’s an agent.”**

ChatATP is laying the groundwork for that world. A future where your AI doesn't just *respond*, it *acts*.
